## PacMan

### Controls

UpArrow, DownArrow, LeftArrow, RightArrow. Just that simple.
Press ESC to pause the game.

### Rules

Try your best to beat the high score! You will only get a 1UP when reaching 10000 points. Eating ghosts is a great way to earn points, but you can only eat them after eating a power pellet (*O*). Otherwise, they eat you! The game's over when you lose all your lives, after ghosts ate you so many times. Eat all the pellets to reach the next level, which will be a bit faster!
A bonus fruit (which will earn you 200 points) will appear every now and then. Hurry up before it disappears!

### Deploy

To deploy the game, you need to extract the file 'deploy/deploy.zip' and start a web server, at the extracted directory. You can use the extension [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related).
